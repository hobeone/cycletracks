Add public/private field to activity
Check license of all imported code
show only users tracks on dashboards
show public tracks dashboards somewhere
search public tracks
allow proper naming of tracks
Geocode start and stop points of track to names
layout redo, make it non table based, that's sooo last century
add max number of tracks per user
check max length of text property (where we store the lists of points etc)
add time labels to bottom of the graphs
better TCX parsing and graceful failure
only store downsampled data?
