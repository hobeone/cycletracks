Caveats about data representation in cycletracks:

<ul>
  <li>Times are rounded to integers of seconds</li>
  <li>Graph datapoints are compressed down to 500 points</li>
  <li>Map data is encoded before rendering (to save space) but this may introduce some imprecision into the geo points.</li>
  <li>It's kinda hacky
</ul>
