#summary Getting started

= Introduction =

Very Basic intro:
  * install subversion and python
  * svn co  http://cycletracks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cycletracks cycletracks
  * cd cycletracks
  * python manage.py runserver
  * point your browser to http://localhost:8000
  * check the source for TODOs and do them!


Notes:
  * I'm using svn versions of django and appengine_django plugins so there are a few warning of deprecated features when you start the server.
  * I hate XML
